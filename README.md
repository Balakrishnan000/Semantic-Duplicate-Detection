# CatchDup - Semantic Duplicate Detection App
It is NLP and ML based Project that uses Quora Question Pairs Dataset from kaggle to train the model that detects Duplicate or Not, given a pair of questions.

## Bag of Words - CountVectorizer
- Bag-of-Words is a common text representation technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).It converts text documents into numerical feature vectors. Bag-of-Words represents the presence and frequency of words in a document.
- CountVectorizer is a popular implementation of the Bag-of-Words approach in Python.It is available in the scikit-learn library. CountVectorizer performs tokenization, vocabulary building, and word counting in a single step.

## Machine Learning Model - Random Forest
multiple decision trees. It works by creating an ensemble of trees and making predictions based on their collective results. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalization. Random Forest is widely used for classification and regression tasks, as it can handle complex datasets and handle missing values. It offers high accuracy, robustness against outliers, and the ability to rank feature importance.
